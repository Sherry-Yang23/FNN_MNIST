# FNN_MNIST
This repository contains a Fully Connected Neural Network (FNN) model for MNIST digit classification. The model is built using PyTorch and includes Dropout and Batch Normalization layers to improve generalization and training stability.

## Files
- `FNN_MNIST.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the model implementation, training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib (for plotting loss curves)
- Torchvision (for loading MNIST dataset)

- You can install the required packages by running:
```bash
pip install torch/torchvision/matplotlib
```

## How to run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sherry-Yang23/FNN_MNIST.git
```

Then navigate to the project directory and open Jupyter Notebook to run all cells.
